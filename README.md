## Wasn't Canal supposed to be the new name for Calico?

Canal was the name of Tigera and CoreOSâ€™s project to integrate Calico and flannel.

Originally, we thought we might more deeply integrate the two projects (possibly even going as far as a rebranding!).  However, over time it became clear that that wasn't really necessary to fulfil our goal of making them work well together.  Ultimately, we decided to focus on adding features to both projects rather than doing work just to combine them.
